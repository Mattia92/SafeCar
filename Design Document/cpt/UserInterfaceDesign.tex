Following are some mockups that give an idea of the structure of the application pages.

\section{Splash Screen and Registration \& Login Pages}
These mockups show an example of the \textit{Splash Screen} and \textit{Registration \& Login} pages of the application. The \textit{Registration \& Login Page} allow the user of the application to register as a user of the service, via the custom application functionality or external providers.\\

\section{Home Page}
These mockups give an idea of the application\textit{Home Page}. The \textit{Home Page} presents a \textit{TabView} through which the user can navigate in order to inspect his history trips and a \textit{Navigation Drawer Menu} through which the user can reach other pages of the application.\\

\section{During The Trip Page}
These mockups show an idea of the \textit{During Trip Page} of the application. The \textit{During Trip Page} presents a \textit{View} where \textit{Hints} produced by the application are loaded and viewable by the user. The user can interact with the application using two buttons: the first is a \textit{Pause/Resume} button which allow the user to pause the trip, without stopping it, if he wants to take a break from the driving session and, then, resume it; the second, instead, is a \textit{Stop} button which allows the user to end the driving experience.\\

\end{figure}

\section{Report Page}
This mockup shows an idea of the \textit{Report Page} of the application. The \textit{Report Page} displays when the user inspects one of his history trips or when he completes a driving session pushing the \textit{Stop} button. This page allows the user to see all the details about his/her trip including data like: the trip's date, duration and length, the DSI score and the path he/she made.\\

\end{figure}

\clearpage
\section{Profile Page}
These mockups show an idea of the \textit{Profile Page} of the application. The \textit{Profile Page} shows information about the user like his/her name, surname, email address, driver level and also some badges that he/she can unlock meeting specific conditions. Each badge is clickable and let the user know about its locked/unlocked status.\\

\clearpage
\section{Settings Page}
This mockup shows an idea of the \textit{Settings Page} of the application. The \textit{Settings Page} allows the user to manage some settings like push notifications and smart objects. This page also allows the user to see some info about the application and send feedback in order to improve it.\\

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{minipage}[b]{0.9\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{cpt/img/SettingsPage.png}
		\caption{Settings Page}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\section{Smart Objects Page}
These mockups give an idea of the \textit{Smart Objects Pages} of the application. The \textit{Smart Objects Pages} allow the user to manage smart objects necessary for the application. Using a bluetooth scanner the user can pair his/her device with a plug, used to retrieve relevant information about the current driving session and he/she can also manage all the paired plugs, inspecting or deleting them.\\
